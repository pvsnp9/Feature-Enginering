#### Feature Engineering Steps 

- Feature Creation: 
  
  - Extracting features from dates 
  - Extracting features from Mixed variables 
  - Missing data imputation 
  - Categorical variable imputation 
  - Numerical variable transformation 
  - Discretization 
  - Outlier Handling 
  - Feature Scaling
