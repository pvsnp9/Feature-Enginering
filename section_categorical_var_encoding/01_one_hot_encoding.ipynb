    "#### One Hot encoding \n",
    "\n",
    "One hot encoding, consists in encoding each categorical variable with different boolean variables (also called dummy variables) which take values 0 or 1, indicating if a category is present in an observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the categorical variable \"Gender\", with labels 'female' and 'male', we can generate the boolean variable \"female\", which takes 1 if the person is 'female' or 0 otherwise, or we can generate the variable \"male\", which takes 1 if the person is 'male' and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the categorical variable \"colour\" with values 'red', 'blue' and 'green', we can create 3 new variables called \"red\", \"blue\" and \"green\". These variables will take the value 1, if the observation is of the said colour or 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoding into k-1 dummy variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note however, that for the variable \"colour\", by creating 2 binary variables, say \"red\" and \"blue\", we already encode ALL the information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if the observation is red, it will be captured by the variable \"red\" (red = 1, blue = 0)\n",
    "- if the observation is blue, it will be captured by the variable \"blue\" (red = 0, blue = 1)\n",
    "- if the observation is green, it will be captured by the combination of \"red\" and \"blue\" (red = 0, blue = 0)\n",
    "- We do not need to add a third variable \"green\" to capture that the observation is green.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, a categorical variable should be encoded by creating k-1 binary variables, where k is the number of distinct categories. In the case of gender, k=2 (male / female), therefore we need to create only 1 (k - 1 = 1) binary variable. In the case of colour, which has 3 different categories (k=3), we need to create 2 (k - 1 = 2) binary variables to capture all the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "One hot encoding into k-1 binary variables takes into account that we can use 1 less dimension and still represent the whole information: if the observation is 0 in all the binary variables, then it must be 1 in the final (not present) binary variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When one hot encoding categorical variables, we create k - 1 binary variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning algorithms, consider the entire data set while being fit. Therefore, encoding categorical variables into k - 1 binary variables, is better, as it avoids introducing redundant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exception: One hot encoding into k dummy variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few occasions when it is better to encode variables into k dummy variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- when building tree based algorithms\n",
    "- when doing feature selection by recursive algorithms\n",
    "- when interested in determine the importance of each single category\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree based algorithms, as opposed to the majority of machine learning algorithms, do not evaluate the entire dataset while being trained. They randomly extract a subset of features from the data set at each node for each tree. Therefore, if we want a tree based algorithm to consider all the categories, we need to encode categorical variables into k binary variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are planning to do feature selection by recursive elimination (or addition), or if we want to evaluate the importance of each single category of the categorical variable, then we will also need the entire set of binary variables (k) to let the machine learning model select which ones have the most predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Straightforward to implement\n",
    "- Makes no assumption about the distribution or categories of the categorical variable\n",
    "- Keeps all the information of the categorical variable\n",
    "- Suitable for linear models\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expands the feature space\n",
    "- Does not add extra information while encoding\n",
    "- Many dummy variables may be identical, introducing redundant information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "If our datasets contain a few highly cardinal variables, we will end up very soon with datasets with thousands of columns, which may make training of our algorithms slow, and model interpretation hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, many of these dummy variables may be similar to each other, since it is not unusual that 2 or more variables share the same combinations of 1 and 0s. Therefore one hot encoding may introduce redundant or duplicated information even if we encode into k-1.\n",

    "#### One Hot Encoding of Frequent feature \n",
    "\n",
    "We learned in Section 3 that high cardinality and rare labels may result in certain categories appearing only in the train set, therefore causing over-fitting, or only in the test set, and then our models wouldn't know how to score those observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also learned in the previous lecture on one hot encoding, that if categorical variables contain multiple labels, then by re-encoding them with dummy variables we will expand the feature space dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In order to avoid these complications, we can create dummy variables only for the most frequent categories**\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure is also called one hot encoding of top categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "OHE of frequent or top categories is equivalent to grouping all the remaining categories under a new category. We will have a better look at grouping rare values into a new category in a later notebook in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of OHE of top categories**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Straightforward to implement\n",
    "- Does not require hrs of variable exploration\n",
    "- Does not expand massively the feature space\n",
    "- Suitable for linear models\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does not add any information that may make the variable more predictive\n",
    "- Does not keep the information of the ignored labels\n",
    "Often, categorical variables show a few dominating categories while the remaining labels add little information. Therefore, OHE of top categories is a simple and useful technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "The number of top variables is set arbitrarily. In the KDD competition the authors selected 10, but it could have been 15 or 5 as well. This number can be chosen arbitrarily or derived from data exploration."
